# Gradient Method – Numerical Solution of Linear Systems

This folder contains a MATLAB implementation of the Gradient Method with optimal step size for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) systems of linear equations.

## Method Overview

The Gradient Method with optimal step size is an iterative algorithm for solving systems of the form:

A x = b,

where A is symmetric positive definite. This equivalent to minimizing the quadratic functional:

f(x) = (1/2) xᵗA x − bᵗx.

At each step, the method moves in the direction of the negative gradient of f with a step size that minimizes the functional along that direction. The update formulas are:

dₖ = b − A xₖ,

αₖ = (dₖᵗ dₖ) / (dₖᵗ A dₖ),

xₖ₊₁ = xₖ + αₖ dₖ.

Iterations continue until the residual norm falls below a chosen tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached. 

## Folder Structure

- `main.m` — Entry point. Loads problem data, sets method parameters, and calls the solver.
- `grad.m` — Implements the Gradient Method with optimal step size. Logs residuals at each iteration.
- `problem_data.m` — Contains all problem parameters (A and b).
- `gradopt.sal` — Output file generated by `grad.m` containing residual norm values per iteration.
