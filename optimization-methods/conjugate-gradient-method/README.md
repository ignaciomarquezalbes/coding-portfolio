## Method Overview

The Conjugate Gradient Method is an iterative algorithm designed to solve numerically linear systems of the form:

A x = b,

where A is symmetric positive definite. This equivalent to minimizing the quadratic functional: 

f(x) = (1/2) xᵗA x − bᵗx.

At each iteration, the method generates conjugate search directions that lead to faster convergence compared to the basic Gradient Method, which uses only the negative gradient direction. The method updates the solution by combining previous directions and residuals to efficiently minimize the functional.
The key update formulas are:

rₖ = A xₖ-b,

αₖ = (rₖᵗ rₖ) / (dₖᵗ A dₖ),

xₖ₊₁ = xₖ - αₖ dₖ,

βₖ = (rₖ₊₁ᵗ rₖ₊₁) / (rₖᵗ rₖ),

dₖ₊₁ = rₖ₊₁+ βₖdₖ.

Iterations continue until the residual norm falls below a specified tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Folder Structure

- `main.m` — Entry point. Loads problem data, sets method parameters, and calls the solver.
- `grad_conj.m` — Implements the Conjugate Gradient Method. Logs residuals and other metrics at each iteration.
- `problem_data.m` — Contains problem parameters (A and b).
- `grad_conj.sal` — Output file generated by `grad_conj.m` containing iteration data and residual norms.
