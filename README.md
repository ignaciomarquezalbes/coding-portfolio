# Coding Portfolio

Welcome to my coding portfolio! This is a collection of small projects showcasing my programming experience, ranging from academic work in numerical mathematics to smaller self-directed coding exercises.

## About Me

I'm a mathematician with practical experience coding mathematical algorithms using Fortran and MATLAB, developed during my undergraduate and master's studies (approx. 500+ hours of hands-on coding experience across applied math courses).

During my PhD years, I took a short course on Python focused on mathematical applications. More recently, I've returned to Python to strengthen my general programming skills, and have spent around 75+ hours working with the language across different contexts and small projects.

I have also started exploring C++, and the number guessing game included here is my first project in the language. It was built independently as a way to get familiar with the basics and to try something outside my comfort zone.

This portfolio reflects both the structured, math-oriented coding from my academic background and the more exploratory projects I'm building as I continue growing my programming skills.

## ?? Portfolio Overview

### ?? fun-and-practice-projects

These are beginner-friendly coding exercises created for learning and practice. They reflect my progress in Python and C++, and include classic games and logic exercises.

- **guess-number-game** (C++): A simple number guessing game with input validation and repeated guess detection.
- **hangman** (Python): A text-based version of the classic Hangman game.
- **rock-paper-scissors** (Python): A best-of-3 Rock-Paper-Scissors game with basic logic.
- **bingo** (Python): A simple implementation of a Bingo game (work in progress).
