This folder contains a MATLAB implementation of the Implicit Euler Method for numerically solving initial-value problems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## Method Overview

The Implicit Euler Method is a first-order numerical integration technique used to approximate solutions of equations of the form:

y'(x) = f(x, y),

y(x₀) = y₀.

It approximates the solution in a similar fashion to the Explicit Euler Method,
using the slope at the next point to approximate the solution, instead of the current point.
In this case, the algorithm computes successive values using:

xₙ₊₁ = xₙ + h,

yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + h * f(xₙ₊₁, yₙ₊₁),

where h is the step size  and f is the function defining the ODE. 
Observe that, in contrast with the Explicit Euler Method, this is an implicit method, 
that is, the expression to compute the new approximation, yₙ₊₁, depends on yₙ₊₁ itself and,
thus, the method needs to solve an algebraic equation to find yₙ₊₁ (handled here using MATLAB's `fsolve`). 

## Folder Structure

- `main.m` — Entry point. Loads problem data and calls the solver.
- `euler_explicit.m` — Implements the Implicit Euler algorithm.
- `rhs_function.m` — Defines the function *f(x, y)* for the ODE.
- `solution.m` — Defines the exact solution *y(x)* for optional error estimation (it must agree with the function in `rhs_function.m`).
- `problem_data.m` — Contains all problem parameters (step size, initial conditions, etc.).
- `write_head.m` — Prints a header for formatted output.
- `write_step.m` — Prints values at each step of the iteration.

> Utility scripts `write_head.` and `write_step.m` were provided in coursework and are included here (translated to English) to handle formatted console/file output.
