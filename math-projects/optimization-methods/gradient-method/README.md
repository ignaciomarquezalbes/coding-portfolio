# Gradient Method

This folder contains a MATLAB implementation of the Gradient Method with optimal step size for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) systems of linear equations.

## Method Overview

The Gradient Method is an iterative algorithm for solving systems of the form:

  A x = b,

where A is symmetric positive definite. This is equivalent to minimizing the quadratic functional:

  f(x) = (1/2) xᵗA x − bᵗx.

At each iteration, the method moves in the direction of the negative gradient of f, with a step size that minimizes f along that direction. The update formulas are:

  dₖ = b − A xₖ  
  αₖ = (dₖᵗ dₖ) / (dₖᵗ A dₖ)  
  xₖ₊₁ = xₖ + αₖ dₖ

Iterations continue until the residual norm falls below a specified tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Code Structure

- `main.m` — Entry point; loads problem data, sets parameters, and calls the solver.
- `grad.m` — Implements the Gradient Method with optimal step size. Logs residuals at each iteration.
- `problem_data.m` — Defines the matrix `A` and right-hand side vector `b`.
- `grad.sal` — Output file generated by `grad.m`, containing residual norms for each iteration.
