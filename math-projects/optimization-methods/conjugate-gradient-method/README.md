# Conjugate Gradient Method

This folder contains a MATLAB implementation of the Conjugate Gradient Method for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems of equations.

## Method Overview

The Conjugate Gradient Method is an iterative algorithm designed to solve linear systems of the form:

  A x = b,

where A is symmetric positive definite. This is equivalent to minimizing the quadratic functional:

  f(x) = (1/2) xᵗA x − bᵗx.

Unlike the basic Gradient Method, which uses only the steepest descent direction, the Conjugate Gradient Method generates conjugate directions that accelerate convergence.

Starting from an initial guess x₀, the method defines the residual as:

  r₀ = b − A x₀

Then, at each iteration, the following updates are applied:

  αₖ = (rₖᵗ rₖ) / (dₖᵗ A dₖ)  
  xₖ₊₁ = xₖ + αₖ dₖ  
  rₖ₊₁ = rₖ − αₖ A dₖ  
  βₖ = (rₖ₊₁ᵗ rₖ₊₁) / (rₖᵗ rₖ)  
  dₖ₊₁ = rₖ₊₁ + βₖ dₖ

Iterations continue until the residual norm falls below a specified tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Code Structure

- `main.m` — Entry point; loads problem data, sets method parameters, and calls the solver.
- `grad_conj.m` — Core implementation of the Conjugate Gradient Method. Logs residuals and iteration data.
- `problem_data.m` — Defines the matrix A and right-hand side vector b.
- `grad_conj.sal` — Output file generated by `grad_conj.m`, containing residual norms and other metrics per iteration.
