# Math Projects

This folder contains some illustrative MATLAB implementations of mathematical algorithms developed during university coursework in numerical methods and optimization.

The projects focus on two key areas:

## Projects

- [**ode-numerical-methods**](./ode-numerical-methods)  
  Numerical techniques for solving initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations, including explicit/implicit Euler and Runge-Kutta methods.

- [**optimization-methods**](./optimization-methods)  
  Iterative methods for solving symmetric positive definite linear systems, including gradient descent and conjugate gradient.

More information on each method and its corresponding code can be found in the subfolders.
