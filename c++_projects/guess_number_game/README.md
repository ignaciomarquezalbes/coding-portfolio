# Guess the Number

A simple C++ console game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected integer number within a certain number of attempts.

The game goes as follows:

- The user sets the maximum possible number to guess, as well as the number of attempts.
- A random integer number between `1` and the chosen maximum is generated.
- On each turn, the user inputs a guess. Then, the game gives feedback on the guess (high, low, or right guess).
- Repeated guesses are flagged, and input is validated.
- After each game, the user is prompted to play again.
