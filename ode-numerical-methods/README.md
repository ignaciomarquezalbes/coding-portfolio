# Numerical Methods for Solving Ordinary Differential Equatitons

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of several classical numerical methods for solving initial-value problems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## Included Methods

Each subfolder contains a standalone implementation of one numerical method, along with a sample ODE problem and supporting scripts for running and analyzing the method.

### [Euler Explicit Method](https://github.com/ignaciomarquezalbes/ode-numerical-methods/tree/main/euler-explicit)

A simple, first-order method that estimates the solution using the slope at the current point.

### [Euler Implicit Method](https://github.com/ignaciomarquezalbes/ode-numerical-methods/tree/main/euler-implicit)

A first-order implicit method that uses the slope at the next point, requiring the solution of an algebraic equation at each step.

### [Runge-Kutta Method (4th Order)](https://github.com/ignaciomarquezalbes/ode-numerical-methods/tree/main/runge-kutta)

A widely used higher-order method that improves accuracy by evaluating intermediate slopes.
